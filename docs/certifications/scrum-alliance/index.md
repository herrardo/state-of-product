## Certified Scrum Product Owner®

Product owners have a unique and demanding role on agile teams. A product owner
decides what the team will create next in order to deliver more value to the
customer. In a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO®) class, you'll learn the
framework, principles, and values that make scrum work, plus key skills and
tools you need to be effective. You will discover how to juggle multiple
stakeholders’ needs, get hands-on practice creating a product vision, and learn
new ways to get to know your customers so that you can choose the right next
piece of value to bring to market for them.
